Project: Petroleum Product Consumption Analysis Using MySQL
This project involved analyzing a government dataset on petroleum product consumption using MySQL. The process began with thorough data cleaning — handling duplicates, renaming inconsistent columns, and converting month–year data into proper date formats for time-series analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was then performed to identify key consumption patterns, such as top-performing products, highest-selling months, and yearly usage trends. Advanced SQL techniques like CTEs, window functions, and conditional aggregations were applied to uncover insights and detect anomalies. The analysis provided a clear understanding of fuel consumption behavior over time, showcasing MySQL’s effectiveness for large-scale data analysis and reporting.
