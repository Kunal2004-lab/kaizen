# Big Data Analysis of Petroleum Product Consumption in India Using PySpark

## 📘 Project Overview
This project analyzes the **monthly consumption of petroleum products in India** using **Apache Spark (PySpark)** for data processing and **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for visualization.

The dataset (government-sourced) contains product-wise consumption (in thousand metric tonnes) across multiple years.  
The analysis focuses on trends, dominant products, and consumption variations using Big Data techniques.

## ⚙️ Tools and Technologies
- **Apache Spark (PySpark)**
- **Python**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Big Data Analytics**

---

## 📊 Key Analyses
- Yearly total petroleum consumption  
- Product-wise total and average consumption  
- Top 10 products by usage  
- Yearly consumption trends for top 5 products  
- Product share (pie chart)  
- Average monthly consumption trend (seasonal pattern)

---

## 🧠 Insights
- **HSD (Diesel)** and **MS (Petrol)** dominate total consumption.  
- **LPG** shows the most consistent and stable demand.  
- Consumption peaked in 2022 before slightly declining in 2023.  
- Seasonal variation observed in monthly averages.
